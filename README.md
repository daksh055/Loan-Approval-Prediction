# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction App

This project is a **Machine Learning-based web app** built using **Streamlit** to predict whether a loan will be approved based on applicant details. The model is trained using a cleaned version of the [Loan Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset).

---

## 📌 Features

- Predicts loan approval status using user input.
- Trained using **Random Forest Classifier** (best performer).
- Interactive UI using **Streamlit**.
- Cleaned and preprocessed data with encoding, log transformations, and handling of missing/imbalanced data.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Missing value handling  
  - Encoding categorical variables  
  - Log transformation for skewed data  
  - Feature engineering (e.g., total income)

- **Model Used**:  
  `RandomForestClassifier` (best accuracy)

- **Model Evaluation**:  
  Evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix on test set.
